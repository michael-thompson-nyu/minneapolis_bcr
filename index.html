        <p><b>Behavioral Crisis Response (BCR) Team</b> – Minneapolis launched its Behavioral Crisis Response Teams citywide pilot in December 2021. The program is staffed by the nonprofit Canopy Roots, dispatched from the 911 center, using equipment provided by the city of Minneapolis and funding re-allocated from the Minneapolis Police Department by the City Council. Teams of two behavioral health responders arrive in unmarked vans stocked with outreach supplies, aiming to resolve callers’ needs on scene or refer them to additional supports as needed. Currently, these unarmed teams can be dispatched by the ECC to low-level, non-violent incidents</p>
        <p><b>911 calls</b> - This dashboard refers to all unique incidents where a first responder is dispatched to a service request through the City of Minneapolis Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) database as 911 calls. This includes normal 911 calls where a phone call is made by the general public to request assistance from emergency services as well as “on view” dispatches where a first responder identifies a service need while out in the field and calls it out over the radio.</p>
        <p><b>Eligible calls</b> – 911 calls for service that are identified as appropriate for the behavioral crisis team to respond to by the dispatcher/call taker. There are two categories of calls for service that the behavioral crisis team is routinely dispatched to: Behavioral Crisis Response and Behavioral Crisis Welfare Check.</p>
        <p><b>‘Problem Type’</b> - The call for service category determined by the call taker is recorded as a ‘Problem Type’ in the CAD data. Each call has an initial problem and final problem. The initial problem is how the call is categorized prior to dispatch and the final problem is how the call is categorized once first responders are on scene to provide further context about the incident. This analysis looks at the initial problem type of each call.</p>
        <p><b>Behavioral Crisis Responses</b> - An incident in which a person’s actions, feelings, or behavior puts them at risk of hurting themselves or others, and/or put them at risk of being unable to care for themselves or function in the community in a healthy manner. Often a person exhibiting abnormal behavior may be undiagnosed. This is NOT meant for situations involving weapons, physical violence, medical emergencies, or situations that are not a behavioral or mental health crisis. Behavioral Crisis Response will attend to the following behaviors: (not all inclusive)  </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Emotional and hysterical reactions  </li>
            <li>Psychiatric problems  </li>
            <li>Suicidal ideation/threats (not currently harming self)</li>
            <li>Sex trafficking victims</li>
            <li>Group homes and shelters with person in distress</li>
            <li>Emotional de-escalation</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Behavioral Crisis Welfare Check</b> – An incident in which a person’s actions, feelings, or behavior requires checking the wellness or circumstances for the persons behavior that are not immediate or life threatening. Behavioral Crisis Response requested or required for non-urgent checks on persons in need of:  </p>
         <ul>
             <li>Referrals/Resources</li>
             <li>Intervention on health/home/family situations</li>
             <li>Emotional De-escalation</li>
             <li>Check on vulnerable children and adults</li>
         </ul>
        <p><b>Other Emergencies</b> – sometimes the BCR Team responds to calls that would normally be considered ineligible for a BCR Team. These responses occur because there will be a behavioral crisis component of a call that is classified differently in the dataset. Other first responders can also request the BCR Team to assist on calls.</p>
